- MySQL Server - 
- Maven

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone and import the repository**

    Store the project somewhere for you to access through eclipse/vscode later. Since the goal of this is to eventually separate the front end and backend, you want to close the entire repo for now.

    **Within eclipse**, import the backend folder for now (6/4/2025) as an "existing maven project". the pom.xml file within it should be able to identify it. Note, we might eventually just import the entire repo to include the front end files, but I'm still figuring out if that's necessary within eclipse.

    **Within VSCode**, you can open up the entire repo (frontend and backend folders included). Although, I think we will mainly be working with the front end files here until I have it more properly setup. I'm not sure if this setup is ideal yet.


2. **Configure MySQL Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE react_notepad_db;

   CREATE TABLE `note` (`id` int(11) NOT NULL, `title` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL, `content` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL, `createdAt` datetime NOT NULL, `updatedAt` datetime NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;
   ```
   ** If unsure how to setup a local db, you can look into XAMPP. 

3. **Update application.properties**.
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/react_notepad_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```
    **You probably don't need to update this**, except for the username and password if you choose to use something else besides the default for the local db connection. I currently have it as 'root' username and a blank password as reference.



4. **Build and run the Spring Boot application**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
    You can also setup your own maven configuration in eclipse (so you just hit on run instead of writing it in the terminal/bash), just dm me for more info about it. Besides that, it should be using what you already have installed from the eclipse marketspace.


### Frontend Setup -- CURRENTLY NOT IN

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:8080` (backend API).
